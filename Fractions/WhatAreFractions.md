In this lesson, we will learn:

1. How to understand and write fractions using shape models
2. How to understand and write fractions using groups of objects
3. How to show fractions on number lines

## Notes:

- Fractions are parts of a whole!
  .  Fractions represent smaller pieces of a total (whole) thing
  .  Whole shapes are divided into equal parts
  .  Whole groups are divided into equal smaller groups (number of items)


- If you have 'n' number of equal parts of shape, 
  then each part is worth 1/n of a whole.

  . Ex. 8 equal parts; each part is 1/8 of a whole


- When writing a fraction with numbers, there are two parts:

  . The top (the 'numerator') represents how many parts you have
  . The bottom (the 'denominator') represents how many total parts the whole is
    divided into.

  . Ex. numerator (shaded parts) 3/4 denominator (parts the whole divided into)

- Fractions can also represent groups of objects
  . Ex. Green jellybeans 3/12 total jellybeans

  . if you were to count:
    
1. All the jellybeans it would be: 12/12 jellybeans
2. The jellybeans that were NOT green: 12total-3green/12 = 9/12 not green 
3. the jellybeans that ARE green and NOT green: 3/12 + 9/12 = 12/12 jellybeans
4. If you add all the different parts of the whole, you will en up with the
   whole (when the top is equal to the bottom)
