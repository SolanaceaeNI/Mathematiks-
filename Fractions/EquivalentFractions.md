In this lesson, we will learn:

1. How to find equivalent fractions using models 
2. How to find equivalent fractions using multiplication (and division)
3. How to find fractions in lowest terms (simplest form)

Notes: 

- Equivalent fractions are fractions with the 'same value' even though they
  look different (top and bottoms are not the same numbers)

1. This can be proven by showing 'fraction models'
2. By using the same whole shape and splitting into different numbers of equal
   parts, all the 'shape modles' have the same porportion of shaded area:

   1/2 = 2/4 = 3/6 = 4/8

3. By lining up number lines on top of each other, al the 'number line models'
   show the dot representing the fractoions on the same point along the line

     1/3 = 2/6 = 3/9 = 4/12

                     And so on...


- Equivalent fractions have the 'same value' because they take the same
  fractions (porportion) and 'multiply' BOTH the numerator and denominater by
  the same  number; the 'value' does not change.
     
     1  x2   2                                         3  /3  1                         
     _   =   _    "This is also true for DIVIDING"     _   =  _
     2  x2   4                                         9  /3  3


- Fractions in 'lowest terms' (or 'simplest form') are the smallest equivalent
  fraction
1. DIVIDE the numerator and denominator by the same 'common factor' until you
   cant anymore.
    15  /5   3  /3  1
    _    =   _   =  _
    30  /5   6  /3  2
